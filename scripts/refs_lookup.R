#Refs

#Two ways to append full citation information to other tables

#1
#Loop lookup on each row
#this is probably more practical
#pull out path_abbr and ref
#for each row one at a time
#split refs on ","
#lookup in refs table
#put them back together
#put back into table




#2
#Make new table with rows for each path_abbr and ref
